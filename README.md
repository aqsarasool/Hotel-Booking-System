## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software and tools installed on your machine:

- **XAMPP**: This is a web server package that includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP. You can download it from: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html  
- **MySQL**: The project uses MySQL for database management. If not using XAMPP‚Äôs built-in MySQL, you can download from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/.  

Make sure your MySQL root password is ready before proceeding.

## 3. Installation

Follow these steps to install the Hotel Booking System on your machine:

1. Download the project ZIP file from the GitHub repository.

2. Install XAMPP and make sure it's up and running (Apache & MySQL).

3. Extract the project ZIP contents into the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation. It should contain:
   - `hotel_db.sql`
   - A folder named `project` with PHP, CSS, and JS files.
